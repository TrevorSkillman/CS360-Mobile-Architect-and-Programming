## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The application I have developed is an inventory application that allows a user to manage inventory. Requirements were to create a user log in with the username and password placed into a database. The user is able to create, update and delete inventory that gets saved to an SQLite database. User needs are for whoever wants to manage inventory wether it is personal inventory or in a warehouse setting to keep track of inventory items. 

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The screens that were relevant to the project are:
a.) login/registration screen where users can create an account or log in to their existing account. 
b.) The inventory list screen that displays the list of inventory items in a grid and allows users to navivgate to add and edit screen or delete items. 
c.) Add/Edit/Delete screen this is where users can add new items, edit or delete items.

The UI designs kept users in mind by giving an easy-to-use interface with clear labels, navigation, and input fields. The designs were successful because they addressed the user needs as a smooth user experience. 

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

The approach I used in coding the app is that I broke down the requirements into smaller tasks, using Android Studio for developments, and following best coding practices. I can apply these strategies in future projects to streamline the development process.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested the application to ensure the code was functional and that all the features functioned correctly as expected. Its important to identify and fix any bugs or issues before releasing the app to users. All my testing showed that the code was functional and met the applications requirements. 

## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I had to effeciently manage the data between screens and updating the UI accordingly. Data had to be managed between different components and make sure the UI is up-to-date. All the while constantly getting lost within the project due to there being so many files I kept forgeting which file I was calling for so I had to keep going back and forth between the classes to make sure everything was tied together correctly. 

## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

Well the one component I used that was a pain in the butt at first was the implementation of the RecyclerView and the database interations with it, which shows the understanding of the component and handeling the data storage using the RecyclerView.
